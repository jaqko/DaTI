# DaTI
### Like DaBaby?
___
DaTI is a basic calculator service written in vanilla JavaScript. This is a side-project of mine, as I am working on a game called Corruption. Check [my profile](https://github.com/jaqko/projects/3) for more details. Anyways, DaTI is capable of handling many basic conditions, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division––all that good stuff. There will be a list of implemented features down below.
